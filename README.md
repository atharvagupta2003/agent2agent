# Agent2Agent: Multi-Framework Agent Orchestration

This project demonstrates how to orchestrate agents built with different frameworks using the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol.

## Overview

Agent2Agent enables seamless communication between agents built with different frameworks:

- **LangGraph Agent**: A research agent built with LangGraph and LangChain
- **Agno Agent**: A YouTube video analysis agent built with Agno
- **A2A Orchestrator**: A central orchestrator that delegates tasks to the appropriate agent

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.md)

The system uses the A2A protocol to standardize communication between agents, regardless of their underlying implementation. Each agent exposes an A2A-compatible API through an adapter layer.

## Components

- **Orchestrator**: Central component that receives user queries and delegates tasks to specialized agents
- **Adapters**: Convert existing agents to A2A-compatible endpoints
- **CLI Client**: Simple command-line interface to interact with the orchestrator

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip or another package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent2agent.git
   cd agent2agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # For LangGraph agent
   export TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key
   
   # For Agno agent
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

### Running the System

1. Start the LangGraph agent adapter:
   ```bash
   cd src/adapters/langgraph
   python run.py
   ```

2. Start the Agno agent adapter:
   ```bash
   cd src/adapters/agno
   python run.py
   ```

3. Start the orchestrator:
   ```bash
   python src/orchestrator.py
   ```

4. Use the CLI client to interact with the system:
   ```bash
   python src/cli.py
   ```
